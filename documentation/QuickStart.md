# Quick Start

Ready to jump in?

Here we show an example using TypeScript.

As mentioned earlier in the [Installation](./Installation.md) section, we will always need the CLI.
This example supports both [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [FlowType](http://flowtype.org). Therefore, we will need `@manta-style/builder-typescript` or `@manta-style/builder-flowtype`.
Meanwhile, we need [`mock-faker`](./Plugins.md#mock-faker). Let's add all of them together:

- TypeScript users

```sh
npm install --save-dev @manta-style/cli @manta-style/builder-typescript @manta-style/mock-faker
```

- Flowtype Users

```sh
npm install --save-dev @manta-style/cli @manta-style/builder-flowtype @manta-style/mock-faker
```

## Basic Usages

The Manta-Style CLI works reads a config file that describes your server endpoints and serves the mock data it generates. Once you have added Manta-Style to your package and have your config file ready, say `config.ts`, you may start the server in command line by:

```
ms -c ./config.ts
```

Describing your API end point is also straightforward, simply `export` a type object where the object keys are your endpoints, and the value corresponds to the shape of your desired return:

```typescript
export type GET = {
  '/endpoint': {
    // shape of return
  };
};
```

As an example, let's say we want to mock a `/user` API to get user info.

<!-- _The following config works on both TypeScript and Flow._ -->

```ts
// config.ts (TypeScript) or config.js (Flow)
export type GET = {
  '/user': {
    id: number;
    userName: string;
    gender: 0 | 1;
  };
};
```

You may define a `User` type separately and pass it in as return, like this:

```ts
// config.ts (TypeScript) or config.js (Flow)
interface User {
  id: number;
  userName: string;
  gender: 0 | 1;
  birthday: number;
  country: string;
  state: string;
  city: string;
}
export type GET = {
  '/user': User;
};
```

Normally, a server success return is not directly the `User` object. Instead, it normally is an object that _contains_ a field of the `User` object. It may contain some other field indicating its return status. You can follow the type system's convention and define a `WithResponseSuccess<T>` generic and use it with type `User`:

```ts
// config.ts (TypeScript) or config.js (Flow)

// ...
type WithResponseSuccess<T> = {
  status: 'ok';
  data: T;
};

export type GET = {
  '/user': WithResponseSuccess<User>;
};
```

To mock error type returned by API alongside meaningful data, define the endpoint with a union type of a type for success (`WithResponseSuccess<T>`) and one for failure (`WithResponseFailure`):

```ts
// config.ts (TypeScript) or config.js (Flow)

// ...
type WithResponseFailure = {
  status: 'error';
  message: string;
};

export type GET = {
  '/user': WithResponseSuccess<User> | WithResponseFailure;
};
```

And of course you can create another `WithResponse` generic:

```ts
// config

// ...
type WithResponse<T> = WithResponseSuccess<T> | WithResponseFailure;
export type GET = {
  '/user': WithResponse<User>;
};
```

Now run

```
ms -c ./config.ts
```

Manta Style will start a mock server at port 3000 by default. The example would generate following output in the terminal:

```
Manta Style launched at http://localhost:3000
┌────────┬────────────────────────────┬────────┬───────┐
│ Method │ Endpoint                   │ Mocked │ Proxy │
├────────┼────────────────────────────┼────────┼───────┤
│ GET    │ http://localhost:3000/user │ Y      │       │
└────────┴────────────────────────────┴────────┴───────┘
Press O to configure selective mocking
[FAKER MODE] Press S to take an instant snapshot
```

Now you can visit the endpoint in browser or call `curl`, `wget` and see that Manta Style returns the mock data according to your type definitions.

Note that Manta-Style randomly chooses one of the types in our `WithResponse<User>` union type. If you want to get a fixed response, try pressing <kbd>S</kbd> to enter **Snapshot Mode**. You will find a file under your project directory with filename `ms.snapshot.json` that is exactly the last call return, and the server will always return the response in the snapshot file.

You may also modify the content of `ms.snapshot.json` to make server return the response you want; or use it for other purposes such as saving as test case snapshot or feed in to your `json-server`, etc.

Try pressing <kbd>O</kbd> to enter **Selective Mocking** UI where you can disable or proxy an endpoint, which could also be a quick way to switch between mock server and real server.

## Using Mock Plugins

To use plugins, annotate the field with comments with `@${name}`, where `name` is the variable defined in your plugin, followed by a space and then the required parameter.

The following example showcases several common usages with our built-in `@example` comment and `mock-faker` plugins.

```ts
interface User {
  /**
   * @faker {{internet.userName}}
   */
  userName: string;
  gender: 0 | 1 | 2;
  /**
   * @faker date.past
   */
  birthday: number;
  /**
   * @faker {{address.country}}
   */
  country: string;
  /**
   * @faker {{address.state}}
   */
  state: string;
  /**
   * @faker {{address.city}}
   */
  city: string;
}

type WithResponseSuccess<T> = {
  status: 'ok';
  data: T;
};

type WithResponseFailure = {
  status: 'error';
  /**
   * @example Bad Request
   */
  message: string;
};

type WithResponse<T> = WithResponseSuccess<T> | WithResponseFailure;

export type GET = {
  '/user': WithResponse<User>;
};
```

Check in the browser, refresh a few times and notice that Manta-Style returns the following two types of outputs randomly, and with the expected mock results.

1. `WithResponseSuccess<User>`:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {
    "userName": "Zachariah.VonRueden20",
    "gender": 2,
    "birthday": 646869600,
    "country": "Holy See (Vatican City State)",
    "state": "Massachusetts",
    "city": "South Evietown"
  }
}
```

2. `WithResponseFailure`:

```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "Bad Request" }
```
